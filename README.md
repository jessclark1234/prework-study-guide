# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation behind building this project was to give boot camp students a study guide to be able to view at any time when working through the boot camp course. I built this project to teach myself the basics of coding before starting boot camp and feel familiar with the content I will be learning over the next six months. It solved my uneasy feeling about jumping into the course unprepared/unsure of what I'd be doing/learning and showed me the basics of coding, testing, and deploying a webpage. I learned how to use the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also learning Git/Github, VS Code, good web developwe habits and how to fix certain issues.

## Installation

## Usage

The best usage for this webpage is as a study guide for Git codes, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A number of git codes are saved as reference things one may need to do to merge branches, commit changes, pull code from the remote repository from Git to local and vice versa. A number of notes regarding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have been taken for documentation and resource purposes when completing the boot camp course.
